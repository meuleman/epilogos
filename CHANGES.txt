v0.1.2, September 12, 2021 -- Output files are more consistent in formatting
                              Fixed bug causing chromosomes to not print correctly in "pairwiseMetrics" file
                              Fixed bug causing state numbers to be printed rather than names in "pairwiseMetrics" file
                              Greatest hits now only shows significant loci if using null distribution
                              Greatest hits merging no longer uses 1000 loci when there are < 1000 significant loci
                              Fixed a bug where epilogos would throw an error if there were no significant loci
                              Fixed a bug where one diagnostic figure was not showing
                              Added option to control whether p-values are generated or not (null-distribution)
                              Changed the exemplar generation approach to find the optimal region using a mean & max approach (see paper)
                              Added option to control exemplar region width
                              Added option to control group size in pairwise epilogos
v0.1.1, July 13 2021 -- Fixed bug when not specifying partition
v0.1.0, June 25 2021 -- Initial release
